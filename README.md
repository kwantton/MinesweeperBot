# MinesweeperBot
Course _Aineopintojen harjoitustyö - algoritmit ja tekoäly_, University of Helsinki

## Current state (2.10.2024, 19.49)

It's capable of solving all solvable situations, but I need to update my data structures so that it doesn't stall after a few b-presses (something is causing massive CPU and memory consumption). I had efficient bookkeeping in my old versions, I have not built that yet for this new one.

## Goal
The goal is to implement a bot that's capable of solving all solvable minesweeper situations (done) using coupled subsets CSP, referring to Becerra, David J. 2015. Algorithmic Approaches to Playing Minesweeper. Bachelor's thesis, Harvard College (permalink: http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:14398552).

It should also be efficient (to-do)
