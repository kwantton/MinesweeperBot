class CSP_solver:
    '''
    Takes groups of boolean equations (where each variable is 0 or 1), solves them if possible, 
    and if cannot solve any variables, calculates the optimal guess (minesweeper cell = variable) and passes that
    info to botGame.py, where that safest guess is made (the safest cell is opened).

    An equation is for example a+b+c=2, which would mean that 3 cells, a b and c, together have 2 mines in them.
    That would mean that a=0 or b=0 or c=0 (0 = no mine, 1 = mine). This equation would correspond to a number
    cell with number 2, that is next to three unclicked cells (unclicked and unflagged in my case, to be specific).

    In the case of minesweeper, my variables are not a, b etc - they are (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) etc; (x,y).
    This also makes it possible to sort the variables in each equation, and sort equation sets
    so that an equation chain can be built within each separated equation set so that there is 
    overlap between each neighbouring link in the equation chain, discarding incompatible solutions between
    equations in the set as the linking is done.

        (0) `simple_solver()` in botGame.py is used as long as possible. When it can no longer solve new variables, perform 1-7 below (up until the point where new solutions have been found, don't go further if not needed)

        (1) group equations to sets (1.1 and 1.2); all the members of one such equation set share variables directly or indirectly with each other (indirectly means, via other equations in that set). That is, sets do NOT share variables with other sets, ever.
        (2) 'find_and_group_possible_answers_per_single_equation()': find all alt combinations of 1s PER EACH EQUATION (in each set, which doesn't matter at this step). Each equation MUST have ONE solution (i.e. each number cell on the minesweeper map). There are not too many combinations per equation, since the max length of an equation is 8 (8 variables max, usually 2-6, roughly speaking), and the max sum is 8 for any equation. Almost always these equations are a+b=1, or a+b+c=2, or c+e+f+g+h+j=3, or the like.
        (3) chain link equations: for each variable-separated set of equations, find compatible alt solutions in a chain of equations (practically, thanks to ordering, this chain starts from top left of the map and goes to right, then to next row!), filtering out those alternative answers (alt answers, alts) that are not compatible with adjacent equations, for each equation. Each group of alt solutions = one equation's alt solutions: from all of the alternative combinations of 1s and 0s that DO satisfy the CURRENT equation (group), filter out those alternatives that are incompatible with ALL alt answers from THE NEXT EQUATION IN THE ORDERED EQUATION CHAIN that is in the same equation set (shares variables directly or indirectly with other members of that equation set). This filters away impossible alt answers and helps building the solution trees in the next step (where conflicts are checked):
        (4) from the possibly ok (pair-filtered) alt equations per equation, build alt solution trees from the equation chain; the root is an alt answer for the starting equation, and during construction of these trees, conflicting variable value causes backtracking -> the branch (up until the last chance to go somewhere else than the current confilct) is discarded
        (5) for each eq set -derived bunch of alt solution trees, from the alt solutions, for each var record the number of times the variable value was 0, and the times it was 1. During this, also record the best-bet cell to guess in case a guess is needed later. In effect: find variables that were always 0 or always 1 -> those variables have been solved as 0 or 1 respectively. If can't find those, then you have the best guess cell from the front-seen cells, and if that chance of being mine is lower than unclicked unseen cells' chance of being mine, the best bet guess is the lowest-mine-chance front-seen cell, otherwise it's any of the unclicked unseen cells.
        (6) if didn't find variables that are always 0 or 1, check the need for minecount (it's quite simple at this point). If minecount can provide solutions (meaning, if max number of mines in `self.front` â‰¥ remaining minecount, which means that not all whole-front alt solutions are ok because some of them have TOO MANY MINES), use alt solution mine number counting to check, if the alt solution is ok or not. Once again, for each variable, record the count of var = 0 and var = 1, and if after this filtering-out of bad alt solutions a variable was ALWAYS 0, it has been solved as 0. If it was always 1, it's solved as 1.
            (6.1) if minecount doesn't help (= if max number of mines in `self.front` < remaining minecount, meaning that all alt solutions are ok regarding the number of mines in them), then guess. At this point, I've already
        (7) if nothing else above helps, if `self.solved_new_vars_during_this_round = False` at this point, then guess.

So, connect the first equation (group) to ONE another equation (second 'group'), and that also to another group, and so on (=build a chain of groups = a chain of compatible alt answers). So, for all compatible alt solutions in the 2nd group, couple all of those to the 3rd group (i.e. to the next equation); this builds a chain of equations, where all neighbouring alt solutions are compatible, where the first equation is linked to one equation, the next one to the previous and to the next, etc, and the last one is linked only to the previous one. AFTER 'chain_link_equations', continue to build all possible alternative answers from those, so that there's bookkeeping for every variable for every possible unique alt whole-solution, so that if a conflict is found, building of that alt solution tree is terminated on the spot -> less computation wasted. I think this was called backtracking, as I later found out.
        def chain_link_equations(alternative_answers_per_equation_per_set_of_eqs:list) -> list:
            '''
            returns: list of tuples 
            [ (equation set 1's "compatibility groups", starting equation for these compatibility groups), (equation set 2 ...) ...]
            What does a compatibility group mean: Each alt answer for equation A
            is called altA. For each altA, `compatibility_groups[altA] = set()` which consists of those
            altBs (alternative answer for equation B, which is next in the chain of equations for the set in question)
            which do not conflict with altA. So for example if altA is a=0, b=0, c=1,
            then if altB is b=1, c=0, then altB would not be in altA's compatibility group as it conflicts.
            It could be in another altA's compatibility group. All these are gathered into 'compatibility_groups'
            dict().

            Only those altAs remain that were compatible with at least one altB from equation B (='groupB').
            Likewise; only those altBs remain that were compatible with at least one altA.

            Then the altBs that were ok become the new altAs for the second round; so each non-terminal equation
            is filtered through two adjacent equations this way.

            Then later, this filtered chain of equations (for each separated equation set!) is fed to a
            whole-chain conflict finder, which is a tree where the origin is an alt solution for the starting
            equation, and backtracking is done (branch discarded) in the case of conflicting variable values.

That's why "â‰¥" is written in the game in showing the uu probability ('uu prob â‰¥ x', written as 'other â‰¥ x' in the game)! Yes, this is complicated, sorry.

If that mystery has at least one unclicked cell without a mine, we have to guess somewhere in the box. If the box had only mines, the game would be complete, and nothing would need to be done!
