If not, it removes all those cells from 'self.front'. Previously, I had this whole functionality split up into subcases: chording cases and cases of entering a new cell, but that serves no actual purpose, it's too complicated, error-prone and doesn't really save processing (almost) at all. This is much better, universal, reusable and clearer, and is utilized by the CSP-bot as well too.

This situation needs separate handling because the last 'unclicked' cells can be inside completely flagged boxes, isolating them from 'self.front'. It took me 5 weeks to even arrive in that kind of a situation! It's extremely rare, as it needs at least 3 already-flagged cells in a cordner, or 5 in a center edge, or 8 or more in the middle!
