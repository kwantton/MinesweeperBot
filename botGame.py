    Testing:

    if 'logic_testing_on = True' as a parameter below, then every lost game will be checked for missing logic 
    in 'constraint_problem_solver_for_testing.py'.
        For convenience, when using that, press 'i' and then 'a' in the game; this will toggle on the
    infinite playing mode (which can be toggled off by pressing 'i' again.
    Finishing current game can be toggled off by pressing 'a' again).
        Testing CAN stall forever in an EXPERT game, as the validity testing is slow in cases of a
        lot of variables (it lists all possible solutions)!

    -------------------------------------------------------
    HOW TO PROVE THAT THE LOST GAME CHECKING WORKS? Answer:
    -------------------------------------------------------

    (1) ctrl-f (find) the following, here in botGame.py:

    `if self.solver.guess or self.unnecessary_guesses:                 # (1) NORMAL USAGE: if CSP_solver has not managed to solve any new variables with 100% certainty ('normal' logic OR minecounting logic), THEN guess. This info is directly obtained from 'self.solver', as you can see (`if self.solver.guess`) (2) TESTING TESTING USAGE: if `self.unnecessary_guesses`, then guesses are done -> the lost game missed logic tester in 'constraint_problem_solver_for_testing.py' will notice that missing logic was found, and the 'missing_logic' counter will increase and turn red, proving that it works. Awesome!
        guess(self.solver.guess)                                # you guessed it, it guesses. When 'self.solver.guess' is None, then it performs a not-terrible guess first into corners, then to edges of the map (they have highest chance of being 0, so highest chance of revealing a lot of new information)
    
    ^^ normally the above ensures that a guess is done only when necessary. 
    When 'self.unnecessary_guesses = True', it guesses anyways, 
    even if it already found answers in CSP_solver_old or CSP_solver
    (sidenote: simple_solver will loop as long as it produces solutions, 
    so if it DOES provide solutions, it will return and not go here ever)
    
    (2) run the Minesweeper() with parameter 'unnecessary_guesses = True'. This enables unnecessary guessing
    -> validity testing in 'constraint_problem....py' will find that unnecessary guesses were done,
    proving that validity testing works Perfect! c:
